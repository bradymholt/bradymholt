### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brady. Iâ€™m a software developer by day and geek by night. Writing software is my profession, hobby and passion. During the day, I am a developer at [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) and at night I am usually spending time with my family or hacking on one of my many pet projects. You might catch me playing with TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Ruby, Node.js, Linux, C#, ASP.NET, SQL Server, Docker or the new shiny tool that just popped up.
